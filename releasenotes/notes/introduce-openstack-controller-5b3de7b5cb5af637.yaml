prelude: |
    OpenStack controller implements **Kubernetes Operator** model
    by providing Custom Resource Definiton for
    ``openstackdeployments.lcm.mirantis.com`` and code that handles
    objects defined by this custom resource definition.

    It is written in Python language and is based on
    `Kopf <https://kopf.readthedocs.io/>`_ framework.
    Under the hood it transforms the spec of the custom resource
    to multiple other custom resources (``HelmBundles``),
    which in turn are handled by Mirantis-written helmbundle controller
    and result in OpenStack and its auxiliary services deployed via
    openstack-helm and openstack-helm-infra Helm charts.
